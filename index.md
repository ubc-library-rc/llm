## Introduction to Large Language Models

This workshop focuses on Large Language Models (LLM) to provide participants with a foundational understanding of LLM, their working, how to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM for your own data and ponder on the ethics of AI. 

In this workshop, we will use cloud-based platforms, so you donâ€™t need to have Python installed. Please make sure that you have a Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/) account. This workshop will involve hands-on exercises that require the use of programming tools and libraries commonly used in machine learning, such as Python and Scikit-learn. As such, prior familiarity with Python programming is recommended for participants to fully benefit from the practical component of the workshop.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Understand architecture and working of LLM
2. Fine tune pre-trained LLM model to customize for a sample dataset
3. Understand various aspects of using LLMs for research.
